# My React Vite Template

The code is an edited verson of the React Vite template upon initial installation.

## How to clone

```sh
npx tiged arseth229/my-react-vite-template#main
```
## How to install

run these commands in the order they are given to start the application
in dev.
```sh
cd my-react-vite-template
npm install
npm run dev
```
to convert the template into your own project change this read me, change `title` in __index.html__, and the `"name"` in __package.json__

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
